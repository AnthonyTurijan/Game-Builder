# Game-Builder: Browser Game Milestone
## Objective
- The objective of my game is to be a card flipper memorization game. The user will click on the hidden card and this will reveal the card, once all the pairs are matched, the user will win.

## Project Requirement
- Solo Project
- This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class
- This game must run in a web browser
- This game must be tracked in Github, with a minimum on 10 commits
- This game must be deployed on Github Pages or another location
- This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)
- When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the plaer in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts
- If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in seperate files
- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
- The HTML code should use sematic tags
- The game should have a Readme.md file in the Github repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explain the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used o build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality

## Functional Pieces
- User is able to match cards with matching symbols/color to get a point
- There should be a timer that counts up, letting the user know how much time has passed by
- When the user matches two cards, the cards should remain face forward
    - multiple card objects
- Similiarly, when the user gets two cards wrong, they should flip back over
- When all cards are matched, a "Win" title screen should come up
- Potentially have different levels that add more and more cards as it get harder (2-3 levels in total)
- based on how long it takes to complete the puzzle, the user will be graded depending on the time frame
    - this can be a pop up window that shows up with the victory screen
        - event
            - adds temporary html

## Styling Ideas 
- create cards for the game, something fun and bright
- colorful pallette 
- fun font- legible but bubbly
- win screen: potentially play a sound or have an animation that plays
- background should be simple enough to where it doesnt clash to drastically
